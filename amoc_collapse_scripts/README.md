Scripts used in the `notebooks` folder. 

By running `pip install -e AMOCcollapse` the scripts in this folder are importable by using ``import amoc_collapse_scripts` as is frequently done in the jupyter notebooks in the notebooks folder.

The `path_setup.py` file does require updates when running these scripts on a facility outside SurfSara.
